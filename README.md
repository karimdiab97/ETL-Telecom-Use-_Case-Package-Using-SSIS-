# ETL Telecom Use Case Package Using SSIS

In the realm of telecom, a critical challenge arises: the continuous influx of transaction data from clients that's vital for business operations. To address this, I've developed a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) solution using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS). Here's how it works:

1. **Continuous CSV File Generation:** Every 5 minutes, the telecom company's system generates a new CSV file. This file holds essential information about the multitude of transactions completed by clients over a specific timeframe.

2. **Data Transformation:** The company requires that this raw data undergoes a transformation process to align with mapping rules before being securely stored in a database. This transformation involves reformatting, cleansing, and structuring the data for optimal usability.

3. **Data Flow Automation:** I've engineered a data flow system that efficiently manages this process. It autonomously loops through all the files within a designated folder, extracting the necessary data, performing the required transformations, and ensuring the results are accurately stored in the database. This automated process ensures that no data is left unprocessed.

4. **Auditing and Data Quality Assurance:** To maintain data integrity, I've incorporated auditing mechanisms into the data flow package. This helps in identifying and addressing issues related to missing values and incorrect data types, ensuring that the data remains accurate and reliable.

In essence, this ETL Telecom Use Case Package using SSIS streamlines the processing of critical transaction data, allowing the telecom company to make informed decisions and drive business growth. It ensures that data is not only collected but also transformed, validated, and stored efficiently.
